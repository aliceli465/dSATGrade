# dSATGrade

A quick way for Prep with Jen tutors to quickly grade their student answers!

A couple things:

1) Make sure each cell is either a letter (upper or lowercase is fine), number, or empty. Other than the typical math symbols like "/" and ".", there should be no other extraneous symbols

2) If a student leaves the question empty, don't touch it. The code will account for it

3) Make sure you specify the correct test and whether or not the student got the easy/hard sections for R/W module 2 and math module 2
